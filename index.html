        <p>iGEM, standing for International Genetically Engineered Machine, is the largest synthetic biology competition in the world where multidisciplinary teams are working on designing techniques and building biological devices that will bring novel solutions to everyday issues facing the world. By working on the projects, teams are contributing to an open registry of standard biological parts and the whole competition is stimulating synthetic biology research and entrepreneurship in biotechnology. Teams are also encouraged to collaborate with leaders in the industry and with each other, for the exchange of knowledge and skills. By virtue of marketing and human practices, students are motivated to bring synthetic biology outside the lab by interacting with stakeholders, local communities, schools and many more.

        <p>The iGEM Stockholm team is driven entirely by the team as an extracurricular project and participating students can come from any university in Stockholm. For good project management, the team is usually divided into subteams which are responsible for different parts of the project. Sometimes people are in only one subteam while some can be in multiple subteams, but these roles give a good picture of what kind of responsibilities a typical Stockholm team has:</p>

        <p>A project leader is responsible for the team recruitment and leading the team by organizing meetings and planning the upcoming iGEM year. During the iGEM project you have to keep track of a variety of requirements and to assure that official iGEM deadlines are met. Furthermore, you are not only the contact between iGEM HQ, your team and the supervisors, but you are also the face of your team's values towards the universities and the community. Being a great leader requires a combination of hard and soft skills such as excellent communication skills, natural authority, high capacity in problem solving and decision making as well as being a team player with efficient time management and mental flexibility.</p> -->

        <p>This year iGEM Stockholm is doing a project on guanine biosynthesis using gene overexpression and knockdown in E. Coli bacteria using plasmids, with the aim to provide a better alternative to the commonly used mineral - mica. Mica is utilised in many cosmetics, providing the pearlescent effect in eyeshadows, powdered foundations, highlighters etc. However, many ethical and environmental issues surround the mining of mica, including the large exploitation of child workers in countries such as India and Madagascar, and deforestation to provide new areas for mines. Some cosmetics also use fish scales to produce a similar effect, which require extensive extraction processes to isolate the guanine and produce a low yield of product, not to mention it is also not vegan-friendly. Therefore with the use of synthetic biology, we hope our project will be able to reduce the demand for the labour-intensive mining of mica, and the extensive extraction of guanine from fish scales.
